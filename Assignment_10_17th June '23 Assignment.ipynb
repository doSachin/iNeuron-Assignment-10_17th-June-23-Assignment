    "> 1.  In Python, errors and exceptions can occur at runtime due to a variety of reasons, such as invalid input, network errors, file system errors, and so on. When such errors occur, they can cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably, which is not desirable. This is where Try Except comes in.\n",
    "> 2.  Try-except is a construct in Python that allows you to catch and handle exceptions that occur during the execution of your program. By wrapping potentially error-prone code in a try block, you can catch and handle any exceptions that occur in a graceful and controlled manner, instead of allowing them to propagate and cause your program to crash.\n",
    "        i) Error handling: catch and handle exceptions in a controlled way, preventing your program from crashing and providing a more user-friendly experience for your users\n",
    "        ii) Robustness: make your programs more resilient to errors by handling exceptions gracefully\n",
    "        iii) Debugging: provide more detailed and helpful error messages that aid in debugging and troubleshooting\n",
